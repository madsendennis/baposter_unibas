	%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle

	\headerbox{Statistical Shape Models}{name=ssm,column=0,row=0, span=2, below=overview}{
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\noindent Statistical shape models (SSM) are linear models of shape variation learned from data. PCA leads to a parametric model of the form:
	\[
	\vec{s}= \vec{\mu}+UD\vec{\alpha}= \vec{\mu} + \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \sqrt{\lambda}_i \vec{u}_i, \; \alpha_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
	\]
	\textbf{The Analytical Posterior Distribution:}\\
	Albrecht et al. showed how to compute the analytical posterior distribution $P(\vec{\alpha}|\vec{s}_{g})$ in \cite{albrecht_posterior_2013} with $\vec{s}_{g}$ being the partial data information modelled with an SSM:
	$\vec{s}_{g}=\vec{\mu}_{g}+U_{g}D_{g}\vec{\alpha}+I_{3q}\epsilon$ and $\epsilon\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2})$
	modelling the noise of the observed partial data.

	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0.2em 
		\item Translation: $\vec{t}=(t_{x}, t_{y}, t_{z})^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}$.
		\item Rotation: $R(\phi, \psi, \rho)\in SO(3)$
		\item $\vec{\theta}=(\alpha_{0},\ldots,\alpha_{N-1}, \phi, \psi, \rho, t_{x}, t_{y}, t_{z})^{T}$

	\noindent The standard random-walk proposal $Q$, requires a very small step size to keep the model fixed around the partial data $\vec{s}_{g}$. We introduce the informed projection proposal which keeps the model fixed at the known part of the model $\vec{s_{g*}}$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
